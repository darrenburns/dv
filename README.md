# dv

A beautiful, snappy, and highly interactive tool for exploring diffs without leaving your terminal.

> [!IMPORTANT]  
> It's super early days and this repo is mostly just public to ensure the release process etc is working. dv is good for viewing staged and unstaged changes, but there's no config file or anything yet so I hope you like Catpuccin.

- unified and split diffs
- snappy native terminal app
- beautiful design
- lots of pretty themes
- keyboard centric
- mouse support
